## Review 1
Stephen Kool Restarront So I went to this awful "Restarront" first off this guy didn't spell "cool" or "restaurants" correct. My man has no brain cells like I don't think he can have a thought for himself. Then Don't get me started. On the menu there are 3 pieces of trash on it, and you can only get one of them. Why you may ask well the currency he takes doesn't even exist, like what the F*Ck is  "grebbles" on top of that I think his server was on the same homeless guy I saw outside of Walmart. Now back to his menu he had "cow" which don't get to excited it's raw cow and to make it even better it cost 2 grebbles, then we have white rice  which cost 1 grebble. So I couldn't even buy it. Then we have the "Gruel '' this might as well be prison, all this for a steal of a crisp high five- might I add the high five was maybe a 3/10 on the crispness scale. The owner of the establishment said about his own restaurant and I quote "it's mid af" meaning he doesn't even like it!!! How is this place open like this? Anyway I will be contacting the president to get this monstrosity shut down.
