title: ## Analytics data 
So my data lets me see who's visiting my site, who's making reservations, who's calling, who's ordering what. There are many benefits to having my website. It lets me know if the customers are satisfied or unhappy with my service. It also gives me an edge in the competition, my competitors can't see what I'm selling out on or what actually isn't doing well at the moment. One of my favorite things to check on my website is my revenue. The numbers are almost always going up, this is obviously a good sign. I have a lot of activity on my site and I can track when people actually interact with it and click around on things or open it and never touch anything within the site. I like this because I can see what times of the day people are most interested, this way I know when to have my food be the most pristine.Overall creating this website has been one of the best things Iâ€™ve done for my business and I think everyone should do the same.
