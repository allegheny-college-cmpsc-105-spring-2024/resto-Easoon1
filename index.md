## Discription 

My fine establishment is one of the top tier meat houses in the nation. We bring in food critiques from all over the wrold, they still havn't had anything bad to say about my food,service or decor. I offer a small but esquite slection of meat which are the following kobe beef this can normally only be found in Japan. Next we have Matsusaka beef another fine meat noramlly onnly found in Japan, and finally Jamon lberico bellota. This is ham from free-range pigs that roam oak forest along the border between Spain and Portugal.

## Review 1
Stephen Kool Restarront So I went to this awful "Restarront" first off this guy didn't spell "cool" or "restaurants" correct. My man has no brain cells like I don't think he can have a thought for himself. Then Don't get me started. On the menu there are 3 pieces of trash on it, and you can only get one of them. Why you may ask well the currency he takes doesn't even exist, like what the F*Ck is  "grebbles" on top of that I think his server was on the same homeless guy I saw outside of Walmart. Now back to his menu he had "cow" which don't get to excited it's raw cow and to make it even better it cost 2 grebbles, then we have white rice  which cost 1 grebble. So I couldn't even buy it. Then we have the "Gruel '' this might as well be prison, all this for a steal of a crisp high five- might I add the high five was maybe a 3/10 on the crispness scale. The owner of the establishment said about his own restaurant and I quote "it's mid af" meaning he doesn't even like it!!! How is this place open like this? Anyway I will be contacting the president to get this monstrosity shut down.


## Review 2 
 Time for Logan's hot dogs, he has a whopping 2 things on his menu with one being something you could never imagine. HOTDOGS so it was pretty much the same as a frozen hotdog you could buy at target or walmart. I give them like 5/10, at least they were cooked. Now the other thing one the menu was fries,for context his "world famous" hot dog is $1.99. But the fries are $5 dollars. How can a side be more expensive than the main course wtf. That doesn't even make sense, I can't lie though the fries were well salted and crispy so I guess it's ok they are five dollars. I can't lie if the hotdogs didn't taste like every hotdog I've ever had. I would say Logan's world famous hotdogs are pretty good. However I think he should change the name to Logan's world famous fries, because not only are they more expensive but they also are BETTER THAN HIS HOTDOGS!!!!

## Analytics data 
So my data lets me see who's visiting my site, who's making reservations, who's calling, who's ordering what. There are many benefits to having my website. It lets me know if the customers are satisfied or unhappy with my service. It also gives me an edge in the competition, my competitors can't see what I'm selling out on or what actually isn't doing well at the moment. One of my favorite things to check on my website is my revenue. The numbers are almost always going up, this is obviously a good sign. I have a lot of activity on my site and I can track when people actually interact with it and click around on things or open it and never touch anything within the site. I like this because I can see what times of the day people are most interested, this way I know when to have my food be the most pristine.Overall creating this website has been one of the best things Iâ€™ve done for my business and I think everyone should do the same.
